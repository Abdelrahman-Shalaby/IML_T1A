    # 1) Compute the LS weights using the training data (A_train, y_train)
    #    and the regularization parameter. You can do this in one line with the
    #    equation that can be found in the first problem set.
    #
    # 2) Use the weights to evaluate the predictions on the test set
    # 
    # 3) Using y_test and the predictions, compute the RMS error according
    #    to the formula given to us 
    #
    # 4) Return this RMS value
